DPL (Descriptor / PrimaLisp) v0.8.45.459 / 2013-04-05 

This is the initial release of DPL.

I am working towards making the installation as simple as:

  git clone https://github.com/RobGood/DPL.git
  DPL/dpl-install

Known Bugs

Function calls ending with a comment break the parser.
  i.e. don't do
        (foo bar baz /* xxx */ )
       or
        (foo
           bar
           baz
           // xxx
        )

Anon user has /foo and ~/foo dups in workspace list
Inner interpreter's (report) output goes to STDERR not log file


Future Directions

re-implement dple as DPL app
standalone HTTP(S) server
integrate code mirror for better a dple editing UI.

 ... lots more ...
