DPL (Descriptor / PrimaLisp) v0.8.52 / 2017-01-04

This is an update to DPL.



Installation
------------

I am working towards making the installation as simple as:

  git clone https://github.com/RobGood/DPL.git

  cd DPL && ./dpl
    or
  DPL/dpl-install


Future Directions
-----------------

re-implement dple as DPL app
standalone HTTP(S) server, dpld
integrate code mirror for better a dple editing UI.
better git integration

 ... lots more ...


Known Bugs
----------

Function calls ending with a comment break the parser.
  i.e. don't do
        (foo bar baz /* xxx */ )
       or
        (foo
           bar
           baz
           // xxx
        )

Anon user has /foo and ~/foo dups in workspace list.

Inner interpreter's (report) output goes to STDERR not log file.

dple is not really good at concurrent update to a descriptor.
