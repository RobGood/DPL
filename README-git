DPL and Git
-----------
Basically, a descriptor directory maps to a git repository.

Now, with userids and workspaces, it's trickier.

Currently the notion of workspace is somewhat external to DPL.
Lookups and such are handled within DPL but specifying a workspace
to operation in is done externally within scripts dple and dplx.
So it only works (easily) from web clients, not within code :(

I'd like to have a builtin:
  (workspace -name- -exprs-...)
  (workspace -name-!)

    that does the same thing so that those scripts can just call
    (workspace)



Use cases
---------
These are currently done by commandline, outside of DPL.  I'd like to
be able to do these via builtins, but will have to deal with ssh keys,
etc. when doing a push, so for now it's just commandline.

    Create a new DPL workspace and make it a local git repo
      in a browser, go to:
        http://.../api/dple?_workspaceName=NEW_NAME_HERE

      then go to:
        http://.../api/eval?expr=(git init)

    Create a new remote git repo
      go to http://hub.primal.com/dpl
        add a the new repository

      in a shell run:
        cd descriptor-dir/...
        git remote add origin -git-ssh-url-from-above-
        git push origin master

    Create a new DPL workspace and initialize it from a remote repo
      in a browser, go to:
        http://.../api/dple?_workspaceName=NEW_NAME_HERE

      then go to:
        http://.../api/eval?expr=(git clone -git-http-url-)

    Add new descriptors to next commit
      cd descriptor-dir/...
      git add ...

    Remove descriptors from next commit

    Make next commit to local repo
      cd descriptor-dir/...
      git commit -m message

    Update local repo from remote repo
      cd descriptor-dir/...
      git push

    Update remote repo with local changes
      cd descriptor-dir/...
      git pull



Operations
----------
(git init) # initialize current desc-dir as local git repo
(git add desc ...)  # add descriptors to next commit
(git commit -msg- ...) # commit changes to local repo
(git push ...) # push desc-dir to remote git repo
(git pull ...) # pull desc-dir from remote git repo
